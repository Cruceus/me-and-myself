        Welcome To My Journey
      </h2>
        <p class="">
           I can't seem to recall what page my book is on, but there must be plenty more.
          Hi,  my name is Joseph Patterson, I'm 32 and haven't had much guidance in life so
          I  pretty much go with the flow. I've always been interested in computers and
          only just rescently got into coding. This is my first real step towards my goals
          in a career That I enjoy.
   
        <h2 >For Your Information Section of Me</h2>
          <p>Welcome to the short form of my life. I grew up in <a href="https://www.cityoffrostproof.co/">Frostproof</a>, Fl. I went to school at Frostproof Elementary, Middle, and Highschool. Then at the age of 19 moved some northerly into <a href="https://www.mywinterhaven.com/">Winterhaven.</a> There I attended <a href="http://www.polkedpathways.com/ridge-technical-college/">Ridge Career Center</a> and became a massage therapist for three years. Worked for a place called <a href="http://www.polkedpathways.com/ridge-technical-college/">Publix</a> while attending classes. I worked there four 2 years. Then I started in road construction. I was there for around 2.5 years. The company was called <a href="https://www.rangerconstruction.com/asphalt-paving-orlando-winter-garden/">RangerConstruction</a>. My childhood mostly consited of roller blading, basketball, soccer, and other outdoor sports since computers weren't big back then (or overly priced). I love all animals. I have had at most as 16 puppies at a time (they were 2 stray moms who had babies under our house). Mom Wasn't happy. I used to live next to a farm and would go over and play with the cows and horses with our dogs at the time. Most of them were friendly and would meet you at the gate for pets and treats if you had any. I would watch how they would take care of the farm and help out when they were out of town. For the most part we would jump back and forth on the hay bales.Currently am unsure of what my work Goals are.I mostly just wanted to be able to support myself and fiance enough to have a comfortable life with no finacial worries.</p>
